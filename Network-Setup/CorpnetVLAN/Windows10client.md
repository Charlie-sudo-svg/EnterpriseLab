# Windows 10 Setup

The first step in the Windows 10 Client setup is to install the OS using the ISO provided from Microsofts website. I clicked through the default options in the setup and made sure to select Windows 10 Pro just in case I need any more features later down the road.

When Windows is finally installed, I installed Google Chrome and downloaded Sysmon v15.15.

Sysmon is Microsoft Sysinternals tool that provides enhanced event logging for Windows systems. It allows for more detailed logging than just using the event viewer. This will help us when setting up the Splunk forwarder to get more detailed logs to analyze later when we simulate attacks on the network.

The next step in the process of using Sysmon is to download a configuration file aswell. This will help Sysmon determine what to actually log and what labels to log it with. For simplicity reasons, I decided to download the Olaf Config for Sysmon linked [here](https://github.com/olafhartong/sysmon-modular/blob/master/sysmonconfig-with-filedelete.xml).

After downloading, I launched command prompt and traversed into the Sysmon folder and ran the following command below.

`sysmon64 -i sysmonconfig-with-filedelete.xml`

This installed and started to run the Sysmon service. 

To make sure the service is working as intended, I launched Event Viewer as Administrator and then navigated to the logs Sysmon generated by going to Application and Services -> Microsoft -> Windows -> Sysmon -> Operational.

Everything looks to be working as it should! Now the next step is to install the Splunk Forwarder for this machine so Splunk can recieve telemetry for us to analyze.

I downloaded the 64 bit version of Splunk Forwarder version 9.4.3 onto the Windows 10 system and set it up pretty quickly.

I used the IP of the Splunk Server I configured earlier as well as port 9997. 

The next step in this process is to go to the Splunk instance located at 192.168.30.2:8000 and configure a few things. I configured a new recieving port on port 9997 by going to Settings -> Forwarding and Recieving

Then, I created a new index called "Telemetry" that the Splunk will forward the data to.

Now, I actually need to tell Splunk how to forward the data. This can be done by providing a inputs.conf file inside Windows.

After providing the file, resetting the Splunk service is imperitive for this to work. I went to Services, then I stopped and started the Universal Splunk Forwarder service.
