# Windows 10 SCADA Set Up

This set up will be a little bit different than an actual SCADA set up, primarily because there aren't any actual physical systems in place. 

To still make this as realisitic as possible, I will be coding a program in Python that will be launched from the Windows 10 machine that controls different "aspects" of
this company's water systems, including how many chemical are pumped into the water, the flow of water, etc.
